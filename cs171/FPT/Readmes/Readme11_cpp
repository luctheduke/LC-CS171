You decided to switch to C++ to get cin,cout

Along the way you adjusted the interface of 
most of the graphics functions to explicitly
take doubles instead of ints because the g++
compile would generate warnings when doubles
were passed to int parameters.  You could have
suppressed all warnings with the "-w" switch
but this seemed a bad idea.

Also, some "void *" params were changed to
"const void *" to silence g++ warnings.  The
C compiler doesn't mind these.


You now have 4 compile scripts:
acom and bcom work with C

ycom and zcom work with C++ but will also compile the
   inD,outD  i/o  tools.

bcom and zcom will preprocess the code so that doubles
can be used as array subscripts....acom and ycom will
NOT do this.

ycom and zcom invoke a version of the header file, FPT.h,
that is mildly different from the one used by acom and bcom.
