Formerly, bcom used the unix utility, sed, to
replace array notation with arrays with subscripts
cast to integers.

This has now been replaced by a "C" program,

bcomFilter/filter_arrays.exe

This is actually a better solution since it
will not replace the array notation if it occurs
inside of a doubly quoted string and
it is also good because bcom will now work on
systems that don't have the unix utility, sed.

Of course, when porting this to a new environment,
it may well be necessary to recompile 

bcomFilter/filter_arrays.exe

Just cd into the directory, bcomFilter, and execute

./compile

This should remake, filter_arrays.exe
