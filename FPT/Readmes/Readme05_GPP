in this version, X_graphics and G_graphics have been cleaned up
so it can be compiled by g++ as well as by cc.

this required a reorganization of the header file, G_graphics.h.
in the old version, the header file itself was the source of the
declaration of the storage for all of the function pointers.

now the header file declares these as "extern" and the file
G_graphics.c has the actual storage for the pointers.
